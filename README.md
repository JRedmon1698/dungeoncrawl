Just a little dungeon crawler game written in rust based on Herbert Wolverson's excellent *Hands-on Rust*

### Gameplay
Make your way through each level of the dungeon as you search for the venerable Amulet of Yala. Along the way you will face increasingly dangerous monsters, but also helpful items to help keep you alive.

Use the arrow keys to move around, to attack monsters, simply move toward them, but be careful: they attack back. Monsters will come after you if they see you, so use your corners and corridors effectively to evade them.

To pick up an item, step over it and press `g`. To use the item, press the corresponding number in the top left HUD.

Make it to the final level and find the Amulet of Yala and you win!
